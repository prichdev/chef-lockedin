    <h2>How it all started...</h2>
    <p>It was 6 PM when I dozed off after binge-watching movies. Around 8 PM, my owner's call woke me up. She casually mentioned the front gate would be locked—something I didn't think much of then.</p>
    <p>Hours later, hunger struck hard. I went for dinner, only to discover I was locked inside. No way out. No ordering in. Just me and my growling stomach. Then it hit me—I had old soy protein I'd refused to drink for months. I got creative, mixed it with water, onions, masala, oregano, and chili flakes, and fried it into something truly magical.</p>
    <p>This isn’t just food. This is survival turned gourmet.</p>
